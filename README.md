# CSX_450_1_Project_2


+ DOMAIN

 The problem is drawn from the analysis of wholesale customer data set.
 
 + PROBLEM STATEMENT
 
 Given the wholesale data on 440 clients, we wish to explore between grocery and milk spending using cluster analysis in order to design promotions.

 
 + DATASET AND INPUTS
 
 The dataset to be examined is the wholesale customers which consists of 440 customerS and 8 variables (FRESH,MILK, GROCERY, FROZEN, DETERGENT_PAPERS, DELICASSEN, REGION, CHANNEL).
 
 + SOLUTION STATEMENT
 
 A solution to this problem will be a KMeans clustering model/
 
+ BENCHMARK MODEL
 Unsupervised model cant be benchmarked
 
 + Evaluation Metrics
 
 Given that this is a clustering task, we can measure the success of our model using the silhouette score.
